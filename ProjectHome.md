A.T.I.C.U.S.S., or Autonomous Turtlebot for Indoor Cartography Utilizing the Scout System. Here consists the code of my Masters Thesis for UGA. While included is the RFID Mapping software, this can be omitted and several Nodes, most noteably Random Mapper, Greedy Mapper and BB\_Evolover and BB\_Explorer can be run without using RFIDs and add autonomous mapping to Gmapping. Just start the Gmapping Demo and run one of the 3 mapping methods.Uses DEAP.


To run ANY of these files, run turtlebot\_bringup minimal\_launch and gmapping\_demo, just like the tutorial explains.

A lot of the package requirements can be ignored, such as speach, sounds, and other non important features. The key dependencies are Move\_Base, Gmapping, and ROSPY. For anything using DEAP, this is also needed.

This also needs the RFID driver, written by Travis Deyle. It's in the repository hrl\_rfid.





I did this work while interning at Interface. It is their Scout RFID system that ATICUSS uses. Without their funding, I could not have done this work. If you're interested in getting RFID Tactiles and Carpeting to develop software/ systems for, contact me. They are looking for more applications for this possible product.
